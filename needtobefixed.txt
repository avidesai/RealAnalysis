1. Bug with property tax input field
    - Likely need to create a new input field.js file for just the property tax with its own rules
2. New calculate button logic is not updating calculated fields like replacement reserve
    - Rather than having replacement reserve be recalculated / redisplayed upon sqft change ater calculate is clicked, have it change live when the sqft is changed.
3. Log total number of free calculate button calls hit, and warning at 2 left, shut off at 0 left
4. Help information bubbles for different fields
5. Autofill mortgage rate daily
